Mry (memory) is a distributed ORM for Go that let you access
a database in a distributed fashion accepting requests
from any language that supports protocol buffers. Mry handles
sharding and scales by constraining the data model to
scalable designs. Mry uses nrv (github.com/appaquet/nrv) 
for RPC and cluster management. 

Mry is still in active developement and is part time project. There
is no plan to make it production safe yet.
